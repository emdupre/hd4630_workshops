These are the included workshop materials accompanying [Nathan Spreng](http://lbc.human.cornell.edu/Home.html)'s Spring 2017 course [Cornell HD4630: Introduction to fMRI Analysis](https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP17/class/HD/4630).


This workshop series is run by [Elizabeth DuPre](https://github.com/emdupre). It aims to teach undergraduate and graduate students functional neuroimaging (fMRI) data analysis with little or no expectation of previous coding experience.
