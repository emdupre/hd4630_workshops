In this class, we'll review preprocessing and quality control. If you've run the steps detailed in the Getting Started guides, there's no additional data you should download. 

To confirm you're ready, can you:
* Open a terminal with Docker running?
* Run the `mac_launch.sh` or `windows_launch.sh` scripts?
* Type `afni` into the terminal and have windows appear?

If so, you're ready for the first workshop!

The slides for the first workshop are available [here][slides].
